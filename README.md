# 👋 Hi, I'm Ellen Antes Alston  
### A Cleveland-Based Software Developer with a Creative Edge  

🌐 **[www.ellenalston.com](https://ellenalston.com)**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a full-stack software developer who thrives on building dynamic, web-based applications that solve real-world problems. My journey into tech is unique—rooted in a decade-long career as a board-certified music therapist where I helped individuals achieve personal growth through the power of music.

After completing Tech Elevator’s intensive 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp, I gained 800+ hours of hands-on development experience using Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and modern front-end technologies like React. My background gives me a strong foundation in creative problem-solving, collaboration, and empathy—skills I now channel into crafting user-centered software solutions.

## 🎶 From Music to Code: My Story  
Music has always been my way of connecting, creating, and innovating. As a music therapist, I learned how to adapt complex frameworks to meet individual needs—a skill that translates seamlessly to software development. Coding feels like composing: both involve structure, logic, and an eye for detail, but also leave room for creativity and experimentation.  

Transitioning into tech has been about discovering new ways to make an impact. The challenge of coding and the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects drive my passion for this field.
