## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Ellen Antes Alston! I recently graduated from Tech Elevator's rigorous 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp, where I gained 800+ hours of hands-on development experience, building dynamic, web-based software systems using Java.  

Before transitioning into tech, I spent nearly a decade as a practicing board-certified music therapist, leveraging the transformative power of music to help patients achieve their goals. Music has always been at the core of who I amâ€”itâ€™s been my medium for connection and creativity throughout my life.  

When I decided it was time for a change, I sought a field where I could combine my creative problem-solving, communication skills, and passion for innovation. Technology offered the perfect blend of challenge, impact, and opportunity.  

As a software developer, Iâ€™m excited to bring a unique perspective shaped by my background in music and healthcare. The parallels between music and codingâ€”both rooted in language, structure, and theoryâ€”fascinate me, and Iâ€™m eager to channel the empathy and creativity I developed as a music therapist into building meaningful, user-focused solutions.  

Iâ€™m particularly passionate about creating inclusive environments and bringing diverse perspectives to tech. As I step into this new chapter, Iâ€™m excited to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with talented teams, and continue growing as a developer.
